    # with message code 0x02 and the message content "A machine has already registered with ID [X]", where [X] is replaced with

    # self.hosts_db. You will need to determine what the first_link_id value should be when creating the ServerData object.

    # Client Registration Message handler
    # This function handles the initial registrion process for new client. Upon receiving a Client Registration message,
    # check to ensure that this ID does not yet exist in the network. If the ID does already exist, send a StatusUpdateMessage
    # with message code 0x02 and the message content "A machine has already registered with ID [X]", where [X] is replaced with 
    # the ID in the registration message, and then return from the function. Since you don't know the ID of the new client, 
    # use a destination_ID of 0 when making this StatusUpdateMessage.
    # 
    # If the ID is unique, you should create a new ClientData object with the new client's information and register it in 
    # self.hosts_db. You will need to determine what the first_link_id value should be when creating the ClientData object. 
    #
    # You should also determine if the new client is adjacent to this server. If so, add its ID to self.adjacent_client_ids 
    # and modify the provided io_device to replace the associated data object with your new ClientData object. You can do this 
    # by calling:
    #    self.sel.modify(io_device.fileobj, selectors.EVENT_READ | selectors.EVENT_WRITE, my_new_client_data_obj)
    # You should also send a Welcome status update to the newly connected adjacent client. The message code should be 0x00 and
    # the message content should be "Welcome to the Clemson Relay Chat network [X]", where [X] is the client's name.
    #
    # If this registration message was sent from a brand new client, this server should inform it of all other connected
    # clients on the network. You can accomplish this by sending it ClientRegistrationMessages containing the details of 
    # each other Client on the network. These messages will then be handled by the new client's respective ClientRegistration
    # message handlers. You can check if a given host in self.hosts_db is a Client using python's isinstance() command.
    #
